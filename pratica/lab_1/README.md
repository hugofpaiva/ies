- groupId uniquely identifies your project across all projects. A group ID should follow Java's package name rules. This means it starts with a reversed domain name you control. For example: org.apache.maven, org.apache.commons. You can create as many subgroups as you want. A good way to determine the granularity of the groupId is to use the project structure. That is, if the current project is a multiple module project, it should append a new identifier to the parent's groupId. For example: org.apache.maven, org.apache.maven.plugins, org.apache.maven.reporting

- artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it, then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar, you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed. eg. maven, commons-math

- Archetype is a Maven project templating toolkit. An archetype is defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made. The name fits as we are trying to provide a system that provides a consistent means of generating Maven projects. Archetype will help authors create Maven project templates for users, and provides users with the means to generate parameterized versions of those project templates.
